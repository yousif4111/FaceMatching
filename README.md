## Problem statment
detecting and preventing fraud is a critical concern for businesses. This project aims to address the specific challenge of identifying fraudulent cases in which customers provide our in-store agents with fake IDs containing their own photos. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we can enhance our ability to detect and prevent fraud attempts, ultimately safeguarding our business and customers from potential financial and reputational damage.

## Methodology:

Our methodology consists of two distinct parts: face mapping and similarity measurement. It involves the utilization of two models, MTCNN for face detection and ArcFace for face embedding extraction, to achieve accurate results in detecting fraudulent cases. 📝🔍

Part 1: Face Mapping (Database Initialization):
- In the first phase, we map all the faces in our database of customer IDs. 📸📂
- We apply the MTCNN model to detect and extract the faces from the provided customer ID photos. 📷✂️
- Using the ArcFace model, we generate face embeddings, which capture the essential facial features, and store them securely in our database. 🔒🔢
- This mapping process is performed initially to establish a reference for future comparisons. 🌟

Part 2: Similarity Measurement (Real-time Detection):
- When an agent takes a photo of a customer's ID, we employ the MTCNN model to detect and extract the face from the photo. 👥📸
- Utilizing the ArcFace model, we extract face embeddings from the detected face in real-time. 🔎🔢
- We then measure the similarity between the extracted face embeddings and the stored face embeddings in our database. 🔄🔬
- By comparing the similarity scores, we identify any matches or similarities, indicating potential fraudulent cases. ⚠️🔍
- If a suspicious match is detected, we promptly inform our agent to take necessary actions to prevent fraudulent transactions. 🚫⚠️💡

By implementing this two-part methodology, we establish a robust system for detecting fraudulent cases involving customers providing fake IDs with their own photos. The combination of MTCNN for face detection and ArcFace for face embedding extraction enables us to accurately measure the similarity between customer faces and our database, empowering our agents to identify and address potential fraud attempts in real-time. 🛡️🔍
